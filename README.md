# RoboBaby
A collection of code and controls algorithms for the W11 Senior Project team at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo.

We are creating an automatic way to soothe babies without direct parent involvement.
Based on clinical methods to soothe infants, our device will incorporate rocking, sound, scent, swaddling, and heat to
keep a baby as comfortable as possible. This repository will contain all code to make the product function. Our product
will operate in states shown here, in this Finite State Machine Diagram.

INSERT FSM

Each state will have a list of tasks and functions that it can perform, and these will be controlled to best soothe the 
infant. Each state is further defined in a unique task diagram, as shown here.

INSERT TD_SLEEP
INSERT TD_LOW
INSERT TD_MID
INSERT TD_HIGH
INSERT TD_INIT
